# retail_pipeline
This project automates the process of cleaning, transforming, and consolidating retail CSV files into ready-to-use reports. Itâ€™s built with Python and pandas using a modular structure; separate components handle configuration, file checks, data loading, cleaning, saving, and reporting.


# To run unit tests
Run from the root:  

```python tests\test_name.py```  

Run all test files at once:  

```python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test*.py"```
